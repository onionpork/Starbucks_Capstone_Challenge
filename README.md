2. Preparing data 
3. Data processing - data wrangling, and putting into good shape.
4. Analysing Modelling and Visualizing
5. Evaluation

## Conclusion
1. We should dig in social channel and member income to further investigate the reason why those two are that important to the ‘No stimulus’ and ‘Stimulus’ classification. That would help to improve the channel to send out the offers, making it more efficient. Also, based on the differences among members with varied income, maybe designing alternative offer for them to use.
